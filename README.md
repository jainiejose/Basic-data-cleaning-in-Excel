# Basic data cleaning in Excel

This project makes use of data sourced from [UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/online+retail), a popular repository for machine learning datasets. In particular, we will be using the "Online Retail Data Set". 

Why is data cleaning important? Data cleansing, or cleaning, is simply the process of identifying and fixing any issues with a data set. The objective of data cleaning is to fix any data that is incorrect, inaccurate, incomplete, incorrectly formatted, duplicated, or even irrelevant information in the data set. Having clean data provides you better insights about your customers. Without clean data, business leaders can't trust they're making sound, strategic decisions.

### About the dataset

Dataset: Online retail.xlsx (42.2 MB)

Description: This contains a transnational data set which contains all the transactions occurring between 01/12/2010 and 09/12/2011 for a UK-based and registered non-store online retail.The company mainly sells unique all-occasion gifts. Many customers of the company are wholesalers.

The original xlsx file consists of 2 sheets - Year 2009-2010 & Year 2010-2011. For this project, I will be working with the data from the sheet "Year 2009-2010" only.
The following descriptions of the 9 variables in the dataset are taken from the UCI web site:

* InvoiceNo: Invoice number. Nominal, a 6-digit integral number uniquely assigned to each transaction. If this code starts with letter 'c', it indicates a cancellation.
* StockCode: Product (item) code. Nominal, a 5-digit integral number uniquely assigned to each distinct product.
* Description: Product (item) name. Nominal.
* Quantity: The quantities of each product (item) per transaction. Numeric.
* InvoiceDate: Invoice date and time. Numeric, the day and time when each transaction was generated.
* UnitPrice: Unit price. Numeric, Product price per unit in sterling.
* CustomerID: Customer number. Nominal, a 5-digit integral number uniquely assigned to each customer.
* Country: Country name. Nominal, the name of the country where each customer resides.

### Goal of this project:
Cleaning data in excel depends on what the data is to be used for. However, for the purpose of this project, data was cleaned to ensure that all rows and columns are properly readable and filled with necessary information.
